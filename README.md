# MERN Task Tracker App

A full-stack task management application built entirely by me, **Chao (Glen) Xu**, using the **MERN** stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and **Vite** for fast frontend development.
This app allows users to **create, read, update, and delete** tasks with persistent storage in MongoDB.
